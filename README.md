### Inspiration | Why BlockForest?

By leveraging transactions on the TRON network and utilizing their power to contribute to a greener earth, BlockForest has found inspiration. Every day, millions of transactions are performed on TRON, making it a great opportunity to aggregate these transactions and use them to create a positive impact on the environment. In accordance with this concept, BlockForest has been developed to collect all transaction records on the TRON network and allocate carbon credit quotas to TRON users. Each transaction made by a user on TRON earns them one carbon credit quota, which can then be used to purchase a carbon credit associated with the transaction and offset its environmental impact. This approach has encouraged more TRON users to buy carbon credits for their transactions, creating a positive influence on the TRON ecosystem.


### The Green Concept Behind | How BlockForest works?

BlockForest's unique tree block chain mechanism is at the core of its green concept. Each tree block is designed to accumulate carbon credits contributed by users of the TRON network. Once a tree block has collected enough carbon credits, the funds are automatically transferred to the BlockForest fund pool, enabling the team to plant a real-life tree. At the same time, a new tree block is opened and added to the chain to continue the cycle. As more users purchase carbon credits for their transactions on TRON, this positive infinite loop continues, resulting in an increasing number of trees being planted on Earth. Ultimately, this loop contributes to building a more sustainable planet and transforming TRON into a greener network.

BlockForest is currently collaborating with Exabytes (Southeast Asia Leading Web Hosting Company) to carry out tree planting activities in the Southeast Asia region. The BlockForest concept involves breaking down the cost of planting a tree into smaller pieces of carbon credits, which encourages more users on the TRON network to contribute to a greener planet with minimal effort and cost.

### An explorer built on TRON, but for the “Green.”

BlockForest has a purpose-driven explorer built on the TRON network with a mission to create a more sustainable ecosystem. It achieves this goal by aggregating all transactions that occur on the network and meticulously tracking the carbon credit status for each one. Users can effortlessly search their account address or a single transaction through the explorer and access their carbon credit quotas as tracked by BlockForest. In addition, the explorer provides a comprehensive overview of planter status, representing users on the platform, tree block status, and current carbon credit status. This provides users with a holistic view of their environmental impact and enables them to make more informed decisions.

### One-stop Carbon Credit Management for Each Planter

BlockForest offers personalized profiles to every user on the TRON network. By simply accessing their profile on BlockForest, users can check their transaction history and the carbon credit quota assigned to them. By connecting their TronLink wallet to BlockForest, users can easily purchase carbon credits for their transactions with just a few clicks. The transactions are automatically recorded in the BlockForest database, and the funds are collected in the tree block at that moment. This makes it easy for users to contribute to tree plantations and track their carbon credit purchasing status. As a result, BlockForest is a comprehensive one-stop solution for carbon credit management, as it integrates the carbon credit marketplace directly into each user's profile.

### The Key Features Overview | How powerful is BlockForest on Milestone One?
1. The BlockForest fund pool leverages a tree blockchain mechanism specially designed to collect carbon credits and streamline the automated process of tree plantation.

2. An aggregator within the TRON network records transactions and monitors the carbon credit status of all users on TRON.

3. The carbon credit marketplace is integrated directly into each planter's (user's) personalized profile, making it easy for everyone to manage their carbon credits.

4. A tree planting certificate is issued for every tree block in the chain and recorded in the planter's contribution profile.

5. BlockForest had deployed on Shasta Testnet.

### What’s Next | Plan on Milestone Two

1. Soul-bounded NFTs are generated for each tree block, and contributors can mint them to display on their BlockForest profile, serving as an achievement, motivation, and appreciation for their eco-friendly actions.

2. More carbon credit purchasing plans for planters will be introduced, along with gamification to make it more engaging and less monotonous.

3. The "Friend of Green" function will be added, allowing users to help others on TRON purchase carbon credits for their transactions. This will encourage more users to embark on their tree-planting journey.

4. BlockForest will be deployed on TRON Mainnet.
